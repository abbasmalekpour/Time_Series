## Time Series
Time Series Analysis in Python: Theory, Modeling: AR to SARIMAX, Vector Models, GARCH, Auto ARIMA, Forecasting
## Description
- How does a commercial bank forecast the expected performance of their loan portfolio?
- Or how does an investment manager estimate a stock portfolio’s risk?
- Which are the quantitative methods used to predict real-estate properties?

If there is some time dependency, then you know it - the answer is: time series analysis.

Allow you to land a job as a quantitative finance analyst, a data analyst or a data scientist.

### We have created a time series course that is not only timeless but also:

· Easy to understand

· Comprehensive

· Practical

· To the point

· Packed with plenty of exercises and resources

We start by exploring the fundamental time series theory to help you understand the modeling that comes afterwards.

Then, we will work with a number of Python libraries, providing you with a complete training. We will use the powerful time series functionality built into pandas, as well as other fundamental libraries such as NumPy, matplotlib, StatsModels, yfinance, ARCH and pmdarima.

With these tools we will master the most widely used models out there:

· AR (autoregressive model)

· MA (moving-average model)

· ARMA (autoregressive-moving-average model)

· ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average model)

· ARIMAX (autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables)

. SARIA (seasonal autoregressive moving average model)

. SARIMA (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model)

. SARIMAX (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables)

· ARCH (autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model)

· GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model)

. VARMA (vector autoregressive moving average model)
